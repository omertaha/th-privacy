    <h2>How to delete your account inside the app</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Open CATE and tap the <strong>Profile</strong> tab.</li>
      <li>Tap <strong>Settings</strong> → scroll to the <strong>Account</strong> section.</li>
      <li>Choose <strong>Delete Account</strong> and confirm the dialog.</li>
      <li>The app immediately removes your profile data and signs you out. You can close the app once you see the login screen.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>Tip:</em> If Firebase asks for a “recent login,” sign in again first, then repeat the steps above.</p>
  </section>

    <h2>What happens when you delete</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Deleted immediately</strong>: profile information (name, gender, birth date, location, industries, education, experience, bio, intent score), discovery preferences, uploaded photos in Google Cloud Storage, cached discovery decks on your device, and your Firebase Authentication record.</li>
      <li><strong>Chat visibility</strong>: once the deletion finishes you no longer appear in matches; existing conversations become inaccessible to others.</li>
      <li><strong>Retention</strong>: only minimal backend audit logs that we must keep for security or legal reasons may remain for up to 30 days. Those logs cannot be used to recreate your account.</li>
    </ul>
